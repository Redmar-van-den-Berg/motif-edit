In order to find editable poly(A) signals, we have constructed a regular
expression that combines the two canonical poly(A) signals with candidate CRIPR
sites while taking the size of the CRISPR editing window and fact that editing
any of the last three adenines in the poly(A) signal will have the desired
result into account. This regular expression was used to find all matching
patterns in the human reference genome GRCh38 [1], a similar approach was used
to find all occurrences on the reverse complement strand.
The results of this search were intersected with a list of known poly(A)
signals [2] to obtain the final list of editable poly(A) signals.

We used the `famotif2bed` subcommand of the Fastools [3] package (version
1.0.2) for finding patterns in a reference sequence using regular expressions.
All genome arithmetic was done using bedtools [4] (version 2.27.1). The full
procedure is available online [5] under the MIT Open Source license.
