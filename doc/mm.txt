Genome-wide detection of editable polyadenylation signals

A polyadenylation signal can be edited in two ways; either by modification of
the conserved adenines directly, or by modification of the conserved thymines
on the reverse complement strand.

In order to find all editable polyadenylation signals for the canonical motifs
AATAAA and ATTAAA, we have constructed a pair of regular expressions for each of
these motifs that combines the polyadenylation signal motif sequence with a PAM
site for SpCas9 (5’-NGG-3’) at the appropriate distance from the targeted
adenines so that they fall in the activity window of SpABEmax24.

This pair of regular expressions was used to find all matching patterns in the
human reference genome GRCh38 [1], a similar approach was used to find all
occurrences on the reverse complement strand. The results of this search were
intersected with a list of known polyadenylation signals [2] to obtain the
final list of editable polyadenylation signals.

We used the `famotif2bed` subcommand of the Fastools [3] package (version
1.0.2) for finding patterns in a reference sequence using regular expressions.
All genome arithmetic was done using bedtools [4] (version 2.27.1). The full
procedure is available online [5] under the MIT Open Source license.
